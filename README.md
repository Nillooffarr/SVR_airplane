# SVR_airplane
Simulation &amp; Virtual reality project with EEG signal processing and Unity scene
The experiment consists of having the participant play a simple 2D game developed in Unity
The game has 3 levels: level 1 with 2 color of airplanes, level 2 with 3 and level 3 with random objects while a noise is playing 
The participant is required to count the "random" object while the EEG signal is measured by BrainAmp 
The script for each level is uploaded here
The EEG signal is processed in MATLAB by BrainVision extension to assess the stress from theta and alpha wave
